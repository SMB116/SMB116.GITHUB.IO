Intrigued by its success, I embarked on a marketing analytics project to uncover DoorDash's customer dynamics and demographic insights. Using Excel's powerful functions, dynamic graphs, and pivot tables, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to analyze demographic attributes and gain a deeper understanding of DoorDash's customer base. By harnessing the analytical capabilities of Excel, I aimed to provide valuable insights that would guide strategic decision-making, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately enhance DoorDash's success in the competitive food delivery market.
