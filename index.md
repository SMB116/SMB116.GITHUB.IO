In the fast-paced world of food delivery services, DoorDash has emerged as a leader, transforming how we satisfy our cravings. Intrigued by its success, I embarked on a marketing analytics project to uncover DoorDash's customer dynamics and demographic insights. Using Excel's powerful functions, dynamic graphs, and pivot tables, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to analyze demographic attributes and gain a deeper understanding of DoorDash's customer base. By harnessing the analytical capabilities of Excel, I aimed to provide valuable insights that would guide strategic decision-making, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately enhance DoorDash's success in the competitive food delivery market.

"A good education is the foundation for a better future." - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts

In this Tableau project, I bring this quote to life by diving into the Massachusetts education system. Through captivating data analysis and visualization, I uncover insights on top-performing elementary math schools, struggling high schools, and the impact of class size on college attendance. It's a journey that reveals both impressive achievements and pressing concerns, highlighting the transformative power of education.

During my virtual internship at PwC Switzerland, I embraced an exciting challenge from telecom company PayNow. They needed a dashboard to monitor agents' performance and gain insights into customer behavior. The dashboard focused on crucial subtopics, including answered/unanswered calls, calls per hour/month, speed to answer calls, resolved/unsolved call numbers, topics discussed in calls, and average satisfaction rating. I meticulously processed and cleaned their data with Excel, DAX and Power Query, ensuring accuracy for dashboard development. Leveraging Power BI, I crafted a comprehensive dashboard revealing long-term trends, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency and profitability. This project honed my data processing and visualization skills, delivering valuable insights to a real-world client.
