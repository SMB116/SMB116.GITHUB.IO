Intrigued by its success, I embarked on a marketing analytics project to uncover DoorDash's customer dynamics and demographic insights. Using Excel's powerful functions, dynamic graphs, and pivot tables, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to analyze demographic attributes and gain a deeper understanding of DoorDash's customer base.

This SQL project is a personal exploration of Dominica's relationship with the World Bank using live data. With a strong desire to visit the island, I feel a special connection knowing that my dad's mother is originally from Dominica. Researching Dominica has allowed me to delve deeper into my roots, making the connection to my dad's native heritage even more profound. Throughout the research, I explored the number of transactions, the total amount of money received, the funds repaid, the current debt owed, and identified the most expensive projects, uncovering their focus and significance. Despite not having the chance to visit together, I dedicate this project to him, holding his memory close to my heart.

During my virtual internship at PwC Switzerland, I embraced an exciting challenge from telecom company PayNow. They needed a dashboard to monitor agents' performance and gain insights into customer behavior. The dashboard focused on crucial subtopics, including answered/unanswered calls, calls per hour/month, speed to answer calls, resolved/unsolved call numbers, topics discussed in calls, and average satisfaction rating. I meticulously processed and cleaned their data with Excel, DAX and Power Query, ensuring accuracy for dashboard development. Leveraging Power BI, I crafted a comprehensive dashboard revealing long-term trends, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency and profitability. This project honed my data processing and visualization skills, delivering valuable insights to a real-world client.

<img src="images/HealthcareCover.png?raw=true"/>

---
Embarking on a data-driven expedition powered by MySQL, I traversed a decade's worth of healthcare records from various US hospitals. As a healthcare data analyst, my goal was to unveil hidden patterns that could optimize hospital operations and elevate patient care. By crafting intricate SQL queries, I unraveled the tale of hospital stay distributions, unraveled the specialties excelling in procedures, probed for potential disparities, and deciphered the intricate dance between lab procedures and hospital stays. Guided by the melody of SQL, this endeavor transformed raw data into actionable insights, fostering a more efficient and equitable healthcare landscape.

<img src="images/AdultPupCal.gif?raw=true"/>

---
As a proud new owner of a beagle puppy, I took on a Python project to ensure his healthy growth. With concerns about his weight, I developed a calculator to predict his adult weight based on his current weight and age. Using my programming skills, I created a command-line program that employed a fundamental formula for this purpose. This project not only helped me monitor my puppy's growth but also allowed me to apply programming to a real-life situation. I take pride in having built a practical tool that nurtures my beloved beagle's well-being and helps me make informed decisions about his health and development.
