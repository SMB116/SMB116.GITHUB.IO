In the fast-paced world of food delivery services, DoorDash has emerged as a leader, transforming how we satisfy our cravings. Intrigued by its success, I embarked on a marketing analytics project to uncover DoorDash's customer dynamics and demographic insights. Using Excel's powerful functions, dynamic graphs, and pivot tables, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to analyze demographic attributes and gain a deeper understanding of DoorDash's customer base. By harnessing the analytical capabilities of Excel, I aimed to provide valuable insights that would guide strategic decision-making, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately enhance DoorDash's success in the competitive food delivery market.

"A good education is the foundation for a better future." - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts

In this Tableau project, I bring this quote to life by diving into the Massachusetts education system. Through captivating data analysis and visualization, I uncover insights on top-performing elementary math schools, struggling high schools, and the impact of class size on college attendance. It's a journey that reveals both impressive achievements and pressing concerns, highlighting the transformative power of education.

During my virtual internship at PwC Switzerland, I took on an exciting challenge from telecom company PayNow. They needed a dashboard to gain insights into customer and agent behavior, focusing on subtopics like topic, calls per hour, answered calls, calls per month, speed of calls, resolved problem calls, and average satisfaction rating. I meticulously processed and cleaned their data using DAX and Excel, ensuring accuracy for dashboard development. Using Power BI, I crafted a comprehensive dashboard that revealed long-term trends and empowered the client to make data-driven decisions, enhancing efficiency and profitability. This project honed my data processing and visualization skills, providing valuable insights to a real-world client.
