This SQL project is a personal exploration of Dominica's relationship with the World Bank using live data. With a strong desire to visit the island, I feel a special connection knowing that my dad's mother is originally from Dominica. Researching Dominica has allowed me to delve deeper into my roots, making the connection to my dad's native heritage even more profound. Throughout the research, I explored the number of transactions, the total amount of money received, the funds repaid, the current debt owed, and identified the most expensive projects, uncovering their focus and significance. Despite not having the chance to visit together, I dedicate this project to him, holding his memory close to my heart.

During my virtual internship at PwC Switzerland, I embraced an exciting challenge from telecom company PayNow. They needed a dashboard to monitor agents' performance and gain insights into customer behavior. The dashboard focused on crucial subtopics, including answered/unanswered calls, calls per hour/month, speed to answer calls, resolved/unsolved call numbers, topics discussed in calls, and average satisfaction rating. I meticulously processed and cleaned their data with Excel, DAX and Power Query, ensuring accuracy for dashboard development. Leveraging Power BI, I crafted a comprehensive dashboard revealing long-term trends, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency and profitability. This project honed my data processing and visualization skills, delivering valuable insights to a real-world client.

Just like in basketball, where data don't lie, this project takes you behind the scenes of the Toronto Raptors' thrilling journey throughout the 2021-2022 NBA season. With Excel as my ally, I meticulously refined and prepared the data for unwavering accuracy. The enchanting touch of Tableau then transformed these numbers into visual narratives that captivate and inform. Unearth the hidden strategies of playmaking brilliance, harness the potential of shooting statistics, explore the intricacies of rebounding dynamics, and unlock the secrets of shot-blocking prowess. Beyond basketball, this is a journey into the realm of data-driven insights that can elevate how we understand and improve performance.

<img src="images/AdultPupCal.gif?raw=true"/>

---
As a proud new owner of a beagle puppy, I took on a Python project to ensure his healthy growth. With concerns about his weight, I developed a calculator to predict his adult weight based on his current weight and age. Using my programming skills, I created a command-line program that employed a fundamental formula for this purpose. This project not only helped me monitor my puppy's growth but also allowed me to apply programming to a real-life situation. I take pride in having built a practical tool that nurtures my beloved beagle's well-being and helps me make informed decisions about his health and development.
